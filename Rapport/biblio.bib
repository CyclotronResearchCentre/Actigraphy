abstract = {In summary, although actigraphy is not as accurate as PSG for determining some sleep measurements, studies are in general agreement that actigraphy, with its ability to record continuously for long time periods, is more reliable than sleep logs which rely on the patients' recall of how many times they woke up or how long they slept during the night and is more reliable than observations which only capture short time periods. Actigraphy can provide information obtainable in no other practical way. It can also have a role in the medical care of patients with sleep disorders. However, it should not be held to the same expectations as polysomnography. Actigraphy is one-dimensional, whereas polysomnography comprises at least 3 distinct types of data (EEG, EOG, EMG), which jointly determine whether a person is asleep or awake. It is therefore doubtful whether actigraphic data will ever be informationally equivalent to the PSG, although progress on hardware and data processing software is continuously being made. Although the 1995 practice parameters paper determined that actigraphy was not appropriate for the diagnosis of sleep disorders, more recent studies suggest that for some disorders, actigraphy may be more practical than PSG. While actigraphy is still not appropriate for the diagnosis of sleep disordered breathing or of periodic limb movements in sleep, it is highly appropriate for examining the sleep variability (i.e., night-to-night variability) in patients with insomnia. Actigraphy is also appropriate for the assessment of and stability of treatment effects of anything from hypnotic drugs to light treatment to CPAP, particularly if assessments are done before and after the start of treatment. A recent independent review of the actigraphy literature by Sadeh and Acebo reached many of these same conclusions. Some of the research studies failed to find relationships between sleep measures and health-related symptoms. The interpretation of these data is also not clear-cut. Is it that the actigraph is not reliable enough to the access the relationship between sleep changes and quality of life measures, or, is it that, in fact, there is no relationship between sleep in that population and quality of life measures? Other studies of sleep disordered breathing, where actigraphy was not used and was not an outcome measure also failed to find any relationship with quality of life. Is it then the actigraph that is not reliable or that the associations just do not exist? The one area where actigraphy can be used for clinical diagnosis is in the evaluation of circadian rhythm disorders. Actigraphy has been shown to be very good for identifying rhythms. Results of actigraphic recordings correlate well with measurements of melatonin and of core body temperature rhythms. Activity records also show sleep disturbance when sleep is attempted at an unfavorable phase of the circadian cycle. Actigraphy therefore would be particularly good for aiding in the diagnosis of delayed or advanced sleep phase syndrome, non-24-hour-sleep syndrome and in the evaluation of sleep disturbances in shift workers. It must be remembered, however, that overt rest-activity rhythms are susceptible to various masking effects, so they may not always show the underlying rhythm of the endogenous circadian pacemaker. In conclusion, the latest set of research articles suggest that in the clinical setting, actigraphy is reliable for evaluating sleep patterns in patients with insomnia, for studying the effect of treatments designed to improve sleep, in the diagnosis of circadian rhythm disorders (including shift work), and in evaluating sleep in individuals who are less likely to tolerate PSG, such as infants and demented elderly. While actigraphy has been used in research studies for many years, up to now, methodological issues had not been systematically addressed in clinical research and practice. Those issues have now been addressed and actigraphy may now be reaching the maturity needed for application in the clinical arena.},

abstract = {Actigraphy has become a valuable clinical and research tool to objectively evaluate sleep, daytime activity, and circadian activity rhythms in healthy individuals as well as persons with primary and comorbid insomnia. However, procedures used for sampling, data processing, and analysis are not consistently reported in the literature. The wide variability in how actigraphy is reported makes it difficult to compare findings across studies. The procedures and reporting methods from 21 studies that used actigraphs to assess sleep and wake in adult patients with cancer are reviewed to highlight the differences in reporting strategies. Patients with cancer were chosen to illustrate the methodological challenges related to procedures and reporting in one population. The aim of this article was to advance standards of information presented in publications to enable comparisons across research studies that use actigraphy. Specific methodological challenges when using actigraphy in research include instrumentation, selection of pertinent variables, sampling, and data processing and analysis. Procedural decisions are outlined and discussed, and suggestions are made for standardized actigraphy information to include in research reports. More consistent procedures and reporting will advance the science of sleep, daytime activity, and circadian activity rhythms and their association with other health-related variables.},

abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: Total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency (SE), and wake after sleep onset (WASO) as assessed by actigraphy gathered in 3 different modes were compared to polysomnography (PSG) measurements. Each mode was compared to PSG to determine which was more accurate. Associations of the difference in TST measurement with demographics and sleep characteristics were examined. DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING: Community-based. PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-eight women (mean age 81.9 years) from the latest visit of the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures who were concurrently measured with PSG and actigraphy. INTERVENTIONS: N/A. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: In-home 12-channel PSG was gathered along with actigraphy data in 3 modes: proportional integration mode (PIM), time above threshold (TAT) and zero crossings mode (ZCM). The PIM mode corresponded better to PSG, with a mean overestimation of TST of 17.9 min. For the PIM mode, the estimation of TST and SE by PSG and actigraphy significantly differed (P < 0.01), while the estimation of WASO was similar (P = 0.27). The intraclass correlation between the 2 procedures was moderate to high (PIM mode: TST 0.76; SE 0.61; WASO 0.58). On average, the PIM mode underestimated TST by 68 min for those who slept < or = 5 hr, overestimated TST by 31 min for those with SE < 70\%, and underestimated TST by 24 min for self-reported poor sleepers (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Sleep parameters from actigraphy corresponded reasonably well to PSG in this population, with the PIM mode of actigraphy correlating highest. Those with poor sleep quality had the largest measurement error between the 2 procedures.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Actigraphy has become an important tool in sleep research, however, most actigraphic models have had little evaluation of their sleep scoring software. Some reports have described po or agreement of actigraph and polysomnogram (PSG) results. In this study, we examined the accuracy of the Actiwatch-L instrument with Actiware((R)) software version 5.0 (Minimitter-Respironics, Bend, Oregon). METHODS: We analyzed the sleep latencies and total sleep times in 33 actigraph recordings and compared performance to simultaneous polysomnography. For scoring sleep latency, the default criterion for scoring sleep onset (10min of immobility) was compared with criteria of 4, 5, 6, and 15min of immobility, and low, middle, and high activity thresholds were compared. RESULTS: Of 4, 5, 6, 10 and 15min of actigraphic immobility, the 5min criterion yielded the most accurate sleep latencies. The 5min criterion also yielded near-optimal estimates for total sleep time and wake after sleep onset. CONCLUSIONS: We found that a default 10-min immobility parameter for sleep onset was not as accurate as 5min for scoring sleep latency and total sleep time in this clinical sample. There is a need for expanded samples to further evaluate algorithm scoring parameters and the search for superior alternatives.},

Forty-one subjects (18 normals and 23 with sleep or psychiatric disorders) wore a wrist actigraph during overnight polysomnography. In a randomly selected subsample of 20 subjects, candidate sleep/wake prediction algorithms were iteratively optimized against standard sleep/wake scores. The optimal algorithms obtained for various data collection epoch lengths were then prospectively tested on the remaining 21 subjects. The final algorithms correctly distinguished sleep from wakefulness approximately 88\% of the time. Actigraphic sleep percentage and sleep latency estimates correlated 0.82 and 0.90, respectively, with corresponding parameters scored from the polysomnogram (p < 0.0001). Automatic scoring of wrist activity provides valuable information about sleep and wakefulness that could be useful in both clinical and research applications.},

abstract = {The kappa coefficient is a widely used statistic for measuring the degree of reliability between raters. SAS® procedures and macros exist for calculating kappa with two or more raters, but none address situations when the kappa coefficient alone does not sufficiently describe the level of reliability. When the prevalence of a rating in the population is very high or low, the value of kappa may indicate poor reliability even with a high observed proportion of agreement. Researchers have recommended reporting several other values in addition to the kappa to address this and another paradox of the kappa statistic. This program, developed in SAS® 9.1, calculates kappa, but also outputs the observed and expected proportions of agreement, the prevalence and bias indices, and the prevalence adjusted bias adjusted kappa (PABAK) for two raters. Designed for input of the rater responses in the familiar 2x2 table format using the SAS \%WINDOW statement, users with minimal SAS experience will be able to report these statistics to more fully characterize the extent of inter-observer agreement between two raters.},

abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: Actigraphy is generally compared to polysomnography (PSG), which has been considered the gold standard for sleep studies. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the concordance between PSG and two previously proposed algorithms (Cole et al, 1992; Sadeh et al, 1994) to analyze actigraphic recordings. The minute-by-minute agreement rate was evaluated through calculation of sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. Regarding the sleep parameters, the concordance was performed through the Bland and Altman technique.

DESIGN: A night of adaptation to the sleep laboratory followed by simultaneous polysomnographic and actigraphic recordings throughout the night.

PARTICIPANTS: 21 healthy volunteers.

SETTING: A sleep laboratory

INTERVENTIONS: None.

RESULTS: Ninety-one percent of all PSG epochs were correctly identified by both algorithms, and this accuracy is reasonably satisfactory. The actigraphy was a sensitive method, with values of 99\% and 97\% for Cole's and Sadeh's algorithms, respectively. However, actigraphy had a low specificity: 34\% and 44\% for Cole's and Sadeh's algorithms, respectively. The Bland and Altman technique showed that actigraphy systematically overestimated Sleep Latency, Total Sleep Time and Sleep Efficiency while it underestimated Intermittent Awakenings.

CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study show the utility of actigraphy as a useful method for assessment of sleep, despite its limitations regarding identification of waking epochs during sleep. The Bland and Altman concordance technique was revealed to be a powerful tool to evaluate how well actigraphy agreed with polysomnography. This technique, combined with calculations of sensitivity and specificity, appears to be the most adequate procedure for the assessment of concordance.},

Wrist actigraphy, on the contrary, is a non-invasive and low cost solution to gather data which can provide valuable information in the diagnosis of these disorders. The acquired data may be used to infer the Sleep/Wakefulness (SW) state of the patient during the circadian cycle and detect abnormal behavioral patterns associated with these disorders. In this paper a classifier based on Autoregressive (AR) model coefficients, among other features, is proposed to estimate the SW state. The real data, acquired from 23 healthy subjects during fourteen days each, was segmented by expert medical personal with the help of complementary information such as light intensity and Sleep e-Diary information. Monte Carlo tests with a Leave-One-Out Cross Validation (LOOCV) strategy were used to assess the performance of the classifier which achieves an accuracy of 96\%.},

abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: Current actigraphic algorithms are relatively less accurate in detecting sleep and wake in sleep apnea patients than in people without sleep apnea. In the current study, we attempted to validate a novel automatic algorithm, which was developed for actigraphic studies in normal subjects and patients with obstructive sleep apnea by comparing it on an epoch-by-epoch basis to standard polysomnography. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Multicenter, university hospital, sleep laboratories. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 228 subjects from 3 different sleep centers (Skara, Boston, Haifa) participated. INTERVENTION AND MEASUREMENTS: Simultaneous recording of polysomnography and Watch\_PAT100, an ambulatory device that contains a built-in actigraph. The automatic sleep/wake algorithm is based on both the quantification of motion (magnitude and duration) and the various periodic movement patterns, such as those occurring in patients with moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea. RESULTS: The overall sensitivity and specificity to identify sleep was 89\% and 69\%, respectively. The agreement ranged from 86\% in the normal subjects to 86\%, 84\%, and 80\% in the patients with mild, moderate, and severe obstructive sleep apnea, respectively. There was a tight agreement between actigraphy and polysomnography in determining sleep efficiency (78.4 +/- 9.9 vs 78.8 +/- 13.4\%), total sleep time (690 +/- 152 vs 690 +/- 154 epochs), and sleep latency (56.8 +/- 31.4 vs 43.3 +/- 45.4 epochs). While for most individuals the difference between the polysomnography and actigraphy was relatively small, for some there was a substantial disagreement. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that this actigraphy algorithm provides a reasonably accurate estimation of sleep and wakefulness in normal subjects and patients with obstructive sleep apnea on an epoch-by-epoch basis. This simple method for assessment of total sleep time may provide a useful tool for the accurate quantification of obstructive sleep apnea in the home environment.},

abstract = {Two validation studies were conducted to optimize the sleep-detection algorithm of the Actillume. The first study used home recordings of postmenopausal women (age range: 51 to 77 years), which were analyzed to derive the optimal algorithm for detecting sleep and wakefulness from wrist activity data, both for nocturnal in-bed recordings and considering the entire 24 h. The second study explored the optimal algorithm to score in-bed recordings of healthy young adults (age range: 19 to 34 years) monitored in the laboratory. In Study I, the algorithm for in-bed recordings (n=39) showed a minute-by-minute agreement of 85\% between Actillume and polysomnography (PSG), a correlation of.98, and a mean measurement error (ME) of 21 min for estimates of sleep duration. Using the same algorithm to score 24-h recordings with Webster's rules, an agreement of 89\%, a correlation of.90, and 1 min ME were observed. A different algorithm proved optimal to score in-bed recordings (n=31) of young adults, yielding an agreement of 91\%, a correlation of.92, and an ME of 5 min. The strong correlations and agreements between sleep estimates from Actillume and PSG in both studies suggest that the Actillume can reliably monitor sleep and wakefulness both in community-residing elderly and healthy young adults in the laboratory. However, different algorithms are optimal for individuals with different characteristics.},

abstract = {Current evidence has shown that, overall, actigraphy is an excellent tool for unobtrusive documentation of sleep/wake activity in normal individuals. However, a number of methodological issues remain to be resolved to warrant its use in clinical research. In this paper, we report the results of a study aimed at the development of a new scoring software that can accurately identify sleep and wakefulness. Using total sleep time as an index of comparison, the software was optimized on a calibration sample and prospectively tested on a validation sample. A strong correlation coefficient (r = 0.93, p < 0.008), with an average discrepancy value of 10 minutes, was observed for the calibration sample. The application of the optimal software to the validation sample revealed an even higher correlation coefficient (r = 0.97, p < 0.0001), with an average discrepancy value of 12 minutes.},

abstract = {Decades of empirical observations have established the validity of actigraphy primarily in individuals without sleep disorders. Methodological problems encountered thus far coupled with the widespread use of actigraphy signal the need for concentrated efforts to establish a consensus regarding scoring procedures. Currently available scoring methods show less reliability in clinical populations. To address these issues two validation studies were conducted: one for individuals without sleep disorders and the other for patients diagnosed with insomnia. The results of these two studies using the Actigraph Data Analysis Software as the scoring method have shown that the described system is fairly precise. It can be used for actigraphs with different features and mode of operation and is applicable to individuals with insomnia. These findings corroborate previous research showing that actigraphy is a valid instrument for assessment of sleep and wakefulness.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Actigraphy is a non-invasive and valid method to detect sleep/wake status. However, the technique lacks reliability in patients with sleep-disordered breathing and its results may depend on the algorithm employed. METHODS: We compared three currently used algorithms (the Cole-Kripke, Sadeh, and University of California San Diego [UCSD]) and determined which is the most reliable in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) assessing total sleep time. After identification of the most reliable algorithm, we compared total sleep time with the severity of obstructive sleep apnea. RESULTS: The mean total sleep time was not significantly different from that yielded by polysomnography when the UCSD algorithm was employed (p = 0.798) and UCSD algorithm was associated with the smallest bias. The correlation levels (with polysomnographic data) were mild-to-modest when the results yielded by all algorithms were evaluated, but were highest when the UCSD algorithm was employed (UCSD, r = 0.498, p < 0.001; Cole-Kripke, r = 0.389, p < 0.01; Sadeh, r = 0.272, p = 0.057). Actigraphic measures of mean total sleep time underestimated sleep in patients with severe obstructive sleep apnea (apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] ≥30), and the correlation was low (r = 0.317, p = 0.116), but overestimated sleep, with high correlations, in patients with mild (5 ≤ AHI < 15) and moderate OSA (15 ≤ AHI < 30; r = 0.859, p < 0.001; r = 0.842, p < 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Among the three actigraphic algorithms tested in this study, sleep duration estimated by the UCSD algorithm was the most correlated with polysomnography data in an OSA population. However, none of them was reliable enough for estimating sleep time in patients with sleep-disordered breathing, especially in patients with severe OSA.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To determine the accuracy of a new actigraphy system for the measurement of periodic leg movements (PLMs). Continuous measurements of leg movements, made overnight, are essential to diagnose and monitor treatment for PLMs. We have developed the Actiwatch with Cambridge Neuro-Technology Ltd (Cambridge, UK) to detect leg movements consistent with PLMs, to record these movements from both feet over three consecutive nights and to report standard indices of PLMs. We describe three studies designed to validate this device. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The Actiwatch was assessed on a bench model across a range of movement amplitudes. The level of agreement on individual movements between the Actiwatch and bilateral anterior tibialis electromyography (BATEMG) measures was assessed in 199 epochs from five patients with known PLMs. The ability of the Actiwatch to correctly identify patients with PLMs was assessed in a comparison with polysomnography (PSG) in 50 consecutive patients investigated in the sleep laboratory. RESULTS: The Actiwatch detected all mechanically generated movements (100\% sensitivity and 100\% specificity) on the bench test. On individual movements BATEMG measurement and the Actiwatch agreed on 94\% of epochs. The sensitivity and specificity of the Actiwatch to detect leg movements in severe PLMs as defined by BATEMG (PLMI>or=25) are high (100\% sensitive and 97\% specific). Our bilateral system gave better agreement with BATEMG than previous systems but the two measures are still not interchangeable. CONCLUSIONS: EMG is only a surrogate measure of limb movement and indices measured in this way correlate poorly with symptoms. We have demonstrated that the Actiwatch faithfully records movement, which offers the potential to reassess the relationships between limb movement indices and symptoms. This which offers a convenient and economical alternative to PSG in the study of large populations to increase our understanding of the epidemiology and clinical significance of PLMs.},

abstract = {Wrist actigraphy is employed increasingly in sleep research and clinical sleep medicine. Critical evaluation of the performance of new actigraphs and software is needed. Actigraphic sleep-wake estimation was compared with polysomnographic (PSG) scoring as the standard in a clinical sleep laboratory. A convenience sample of 116 patients undergoing clinical sleep recordings volunteered to participate. Actiwatch-L recordings were obtained from 98 participants, along with 18 recordings using the newer Spectrum model (Philips Electronics), but some of the actigraphic recordings could not be adequately aligned with the simultaneous PSGs. Of satisfactory alignments, 40 Actiwatch recordings were used as a training set to empirically develop a new Scripps Clinic algorithm for sleep-wake scoring. The Scripps Clinic algorithm was then prospectively evaluated in 39 Actiwatch recordings and 16 Spectrum recordings, producing epoch-by-epoch sleep-wake agreements of 85-87\% and kappa statistics averaging 0.52 (indicating moderate agreement). Wake was underestimated by the scoring algorithm. The correlations of PSG versus actigraphic wake percentage estimates were r = 0.6690 for the Actiwatch and r = 0.2197 for the Spectrum. In general, using a different weighting of activity counts from previous and subsequent epochs, the Scripps Clinic algorithm discriminated sleep-wake more successfully than the manufacturer's Actiware algorithms. Neither algorithm had fully satisfactory agreement with PSG. Further evaluations of algorithms for these actigraphs are needed, along with controlled comparisons of different actigraphic designs and software.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Comparison of polysomnography (PSG)-derived sleep parameters (total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and number of awakenings) to those derived from actigraphy and subjective questionnaires. BACKGROUND: Actigraphy is commonly used to assist sleep specialists in the diagnosis of various sleep and circadian-rhythm disorders. However, few validation studies incorporate large sample sizes, typical sleep clinic patients, or comparisons with subjective reports of sleep parameters. METHODS: Clinical series with 100 consecutive sleep-disordered patients (69 men, 31 women, mean age of 49+/-14.7 years) at a tertiary sleep disorders center. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy measures were obtained from epoch-by-epoch comparison of PSG and actigraphic data. Subjective sleep parameter data were derived from questionnaires given to subjects in the morning following their recording night. RESULTS: We found that total sleep time and sleep efficiency did not significantly differ between PSG data and the combined data obtained from actigraphy and subjective reports. Using a high-threshold (low-wake-sensitivity) actigraphic algorithm, the number of awakenings was not significantly different from those detected by PSG. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend the use of subjective data as an adjunct to actigraphic data in estimating total sleep time and sleep efficiency in sleep-disordered patients, especially those with disorders of excessive somnolence.},

abstract = {Actigraphy is a method used to study sleep-wake patterns and circadian rhythms by assessing movement, most commonly of the wrist. These evidence-based practice parameters are an update to the Practice Parameters for the Use of Actigraphy in the Clinical Assessment of Sleep Disorders, published in 1995. These practice parameters were developed by the Standards of Practice Committee and reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. Recommendations are based on the accompanying comprehensive review of the medical literature regarding the role of actigraphy, which was developed by a task force commissioned by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. The following recommendations serve as a guide to the appropriate use of actigraphy. Actigraphy is reliable and valid for detecting sleep in normal, healthy populations, but less reliable for detecting disturbed sleep. Although actigraphy is not indicated for the routine diagnosis, assessment, or management of any of the sleep disorders, it may serve as a useful adjunct to routine clinical evaluation of insomnia, circadian-rhythm disorders, and excessive sleepiness, and may be helpful in the assessment of specific aspects of some disorders, such as insomnia and restless legs syndrome/periodic limb movement disorder. The assessment of daytime sleepiness, the demonstration of multiday human-rest activity patterns, and the estimation of sleep-wake patterns are potential uses of actigraphy in clinical situations where other techniques cannot provide similar information (e.g., psychiatric ward patients). Superiority of actigraphy placement on different parts of the body is not currently established. Actigraphy may be useful in characterizing and monitoring circadian rhythm patterns or disturbances in certain special populations (e.g., children, demented individuals), and appears useful as an outcome measure in certain applications and populations. Although actigraphy may be a useful adjunct to portable sleep apnea testing, the use of actigraphy alone in the detection of sleep apnea is not currently established. Specific technical recommendations are discussed, such as using concomitant completion of a sleep log for artifact rejection and timing of lights out and on; conducting actigraphy studies for a minimum of three consecutive 24-hour periods; requiring raw data inspection; permitting some preprocessing of movement counts; stating that epoch lengths up to 1 minute are usually sufficient, except for circadian rhythm assessment; requiring interpretation to be performed manually by visual inspection; and allowing automatic scoring in addition to manual scoring methods.},

This study evaluates the ability of the device to discriminate sleep/wake patterns during nighttime and during napping. DESIGN: Participants spent one night in the sleep laboratory where signals from polysomnography, actigraphy and WristCare were acquired. In addition, actigraphy and WristCare were used for 3-6 days for nap-analysis. SETTING: NA. PATIENTS OR PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 32 adults aged 26-89 years. The participants were studied in three study groups: all subjects, senior subjects (age > 65 years) and middle-aged subjects (age < 65 years). INTERVENTIONS: NA. RESULTS: Sleep/wake patterns were extracted from polysomnography, actigraphy and WristCare for the night slept in sleep laboratory. The agreement percents between the scorings of polysomnography and actigraphy, and between polysomnography and WristCare were about 80 \% for all study groups. As total sleep time was estimated and the algorithm was optimized for this measure, the performance of the WristCare and actigraphy were similar. Both actigraphy and WristCare overestimated appreciably total sleep time (TST). Also in nap-analysis, actigraphy and WristCare performed similarly as the number of naps and the length of the naps were compared. CONCLUSIONS: The performance of the WristCare can be assumed to be well comparable to actigraphy in sleep/wake studies. The study suggests that the device may be used in long-term monitoring of sleep/wake patterns with similar performance to actigraphy.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We validated actigraphy for detecting sleep and wakefulness versus polysomnography (PSG). DESIGN: Actigraphy and polysomnography were simultaneously collected during sleep laboratory admissions. All studies involved 8.5 h time in bed, except for sleep restriction studies. Epochs (30-sec; n = 232,849) were characterized for sensitivity (actigraphy = sleep when PSG = sleep), specificity (actigraphy = wake when PSG = wake), and accuracy (total proportion correct); the amount of wakefulness after sleep onset (WASO) was also assessed. A generalized estimating equation (GEE) model included age, gender, insomnia diagnosis, and daytime/nighttime sleep timing factors. SETTING: Controlled sleep laboratory conditions. PARTICIPANTS: Young and older adults, healthy or chronic primary insomniac (PI) patients, and daytime sleep of 23 night-workers (n = 77, age 35.0 ± 12.5, 30F, mean nights = 3.2). INTERVENTIONS: N/A. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Overall, sensitivity (0.965) and accuracy (0.863) were high, whereas specificity (0.329) was low; each was only slightly modified by gender, insomnia, day/night sleep timing (magnitude of change < 0.04). Increasing age slightly reduced specificity. Mean WASO/night was 49.1 min by PSG compared to 36.8 min/night by actigraphy ($\beta$ = 0.81; CI = 0.42, 1.21), unbiased when WASO < 30 min/night, and overestimated when WASO > 30 min/night. CONCLUSIONS: This validation quantifies strengths and weaknesses of actigraphy as a tool measuring sleep in clinical and population studies. Overall, the participant-specific accuracy is relatively high, and for most participants, above 80\%. We validate this finding across multiple nights and a variety of adults across much of the young to midlife years, in both men and women, in those with and without insomnia, and in 77 participants. We conclude that actigraphy is overall a useful and valid means for estimating total sleep time and wakefulness after sleep onset in field and workplace studies, with some limitations in specificity.},

abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the validity and reliability of 2 new models of commercially available actigraphs compared to polysomnography for children and adolescents. DESIGN AND SETTING: Subjects concurrently wore the Ambulatory Monitoring Inc. Motionlogger Sleep Watch (AMI) and the Phillips Respironics Mini-Mitter Actiwatch-2 (PRMM) while undergoing overnight polysomnography (PSG) in a pediatric sleep laboratory housed in a tertiary care children's hospital. PARTICIPANTS: 115 youth (59 girls, 56 boys), ages 3-18 years (mean 8.8 years, SD 4.4 years). MEASUREMENTS: Outcome variables were total sleep time (TST), wake after sleep onset (WASO), and sleep efficiency (SE). Epoch-by-epoch comparisons were made between the 2 devices and PSG to determine sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. Agreement between the 2 devices was determined with t-tests and the Bland-Altman concordance technique. Different algorithms/sensitivities, developmental age groups, and sleep disordered breathing (SDB) status were also examined. RESULTS: For both device brands, sensitivity (0.89-0.97), specificity (0.54-0.77), and accuracy (0.87-0.90) were similar to previous reports. Notably, compared to PSG, both device brands significantly overestimated WASO, while the AMI device also significantly underestimated TST. Inter-device comparison of the 2 brands found poor agreement for TST, WASO, and SE. Agreement with PSG differed depending on the scoring algorithm (AMI) or sensitivity setting (PRMM), as well as across developmental age group and sleep disordered breathing (SDB) status. CONCLUSIONS: Similar to previous reports, both new actigraph brands were found to have good sensitivity (to detect sleep), but poorer specificity (to detect wake). Study results also suggest that researchers should adjust the scoring algorithm/sensitivity depending on a study's design (e.g., young children vs. adolescents, healthy children vs. youth with SDB). Further, inter-device reliability was poor, suggesting the need for caution when comparing results across studies that use different brands of actigraphic devices.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to compare the extent to which activity and immobility measures are related to sleep stages and sleep cycles in order to improve the informative value of actigraphic assessment of sleep. We therefore performed simultaneous ambulatory polysomnography and wrist-activity monitoring (AM) in 14 healthy male subjects without sleep complaints. In this context, a simple method for transforming raw motor activity data into a time-series reflecting onset and duration of activity and immobility clusters is introduced. Our results demonstrate that nocturnal AM measures were significantly affected by sleep stage. Low activity levels and particularly prolonged episodes of uninterrupted immobility were associated with increasing sleep depth. On the other hand, high activity levels and prolonged episodes of activity were related to intermittent wakefulness during sleep. Our results suggest that measures reflecting the occurrence and duration of activity and immobility clusters provide a better approach in studying the relationship between activity/immobility and sleep stages. Except for the duration of uninterrupted immobility episodes, which showed a significant decrease in the fourth cycle, none of the AM measures showed a significant cycle-to-cycle variation. Consequently, mean nocturnal motor activity measures provide an accurate reflection of the total sleep period. However, none of the AM-derived measures seems useful in evaluating the cycle structure during sleep.},

On a minute-to-minute basis, wrist activity alone was used to estimate Sleep Time. Blind independent scoring of the EEG-EOG-EMG records was also done to distinguish Sleep and Wake phases. Results from the two Sleep/Wake estimations agreed for 94.5\% of the minutes ((96.3\% among nonpatients). Correlations between the two methods were determined for Total Sleep Period (r = 0.90). Total Sleep Time (r = 0.89), Wake After Sleep Onset (r = 0.70), and the number of Midsleep Awakenings (r = 0.25). Correlation coefficients were higher when the 39 patients were excluded from the computations. On the average, the actigraphic method overestimated Sleep Time by 15 min. Continuous wrist activity recordings provide simple and inexpensive, but rather accurate, estimates of sleep duration.},

abstract = {Study Objectives: To evaluate the ability of actigraphy compared to polysomnography (PSG) to detect wakefulness in subjects submitted to 3 sleep conditions with different amounts of wakefulness: a nocturnal sleep episode and 2 daytime recovery sleep episodes, one with placebo and one with caffeine. A second objective was to compare the ability of 4 differ- ent scoring algorithms (2 threshold algorithms and 2 regression analysis algorithms) to detect wake in the 3 sleep conditions. Design: Three nights of simultaneous actigraphy (Actiwatch-L, Mini-Mit- ter/Respironics) and PSG recordings in a within-subject design. Setting: Chronobiology laboratory. Participants: Fifteen healthy subjects aged between 20 and 60 years (7M, 8F). Interventions: 200 mg of caffeine and daytime recovery sleep. Results: An epoch-by-epoch comparison between actigraphy and PSG showed a significant decrease in actigraphy accuracy with increased wakefulness in sleep conditions due to the low sleep specificity of actigraphy (generally <50\%). Actigraphy overestimated total sleep time and sleep efficiency more strongly in conditions involving more wakefulness. Compared to the 2 regression algorithms, the 2 threshold algorithms were less able to detect wake when the sleep episode involved more wakeful- ness, and they tended to alternate more between wake and sleep in the scoring of long periods of wakefulness resulting in an overestimation of the number of awakenings. Conclusion: The very low ability of actigraphy to detect wakefulness casts doubt on its validity to measure sleep quality in clinical populations with fragmented sleep or in situations where the sleep-wake cycle is chal- lenged, such as jet lag and shift work.},

Following one night of baseline sleep, 29 volunteers remained awake for 36 h, followed by 11 h of recovery sleep in the laboratory. Two sets of analyses were performed: (1) epoch-by-epoch agreement and discriminability index (d') calculations, and (2) sleep parameter concordance with repeated measures ANOVAs. Sensitivity (sleep identification), specificity (wake detection), and overall agreement with PSG, as well as d', were higher for the Motionlogger than for Actiwatch. Relative to PSG, the Actiwatch-estimated total sleep time and sleep efficiency were underestimated and the number of awakenings was overestimated for baseline and recovery; sleep latency was underestimated on the baseline night. On the other hand, the Motionlogger-estimated total sleep time and sleep efficiency estimates were underestimated, and the sleep latency was overestimated on recovery, versus PSG. Despite these misestimations, it was concluded that the Motionlogger provided nominally better agreement with PSG, and that actigraphy generally constitutes a reasonably reliable tool for producing objective measurements of sleep/wake, but that users should remain mindful of its limitations.},

In the first study, 11 children (aged 12 to 48 months) were monitored in the laboratory by traditional polysomnography and by actigraphy for one night. Actigraphic automatic sleep-wake scorings were compared with those of the polysomnograph; total agreement rate was 85.3\%. In the second study, sleep patterns of 63 sleep-disturbed and 34 control healthy children (aged 9 to 27 months) were compared. These children were home-monitored by actigraph for a mean of 4.45 nights (total 482 nights). Actigraphic data were analyzed by an automated scoring procedure. Sleep quality of the sleep-disturbed children, measured by actigraphically derived sleep percent and number of longer-than-5-minute wakings, was significantly lower than that of the control subjects (P less than .0001). Sleep measures showed significant night-to-night stability in both groups. The stability of specific measures and their age trends were different between the groups. Actigraphic sleep measures alone could discriminate between sleep-disturbed and control children with a highly correct assignment rate of 79.4\% and 91.2\%, respectively.},

abstract = {The effects of actigraph placement and device sensitivity on actigraphic automatic sleep-wake scoring were assessed using concomitant polysomnographic and wrist actigraphic data from dominant and nondominant hands of 20 adults and 16 adolescents during 1 laboratory night. Although activity levels differed between dominant and nondominant wrists during periods of sleep (F = 4.57; p < 0.05) and wake (F = 15.5; p < 0.0005), resulting sleep-wake scoring algorithms were essentially the same and were equally explanatory (R2 = 0.64; p < 0.0001). When the sleep-wake scoring algorithm derived from the nondominant hand was used to score the nondominant data for sleep-wake, overall agreement rates with polysomnography scoring ranged between 91 and 93\% for the calibration and validation samples. Results obtained with the same algorithm for the dominant-wrist data were within the same range. Agreement for sleep scoring was consistently higher than for wake scoring. Statistical manipulation of activity levels before applying the scoring algorithm indicated that this algorithm is quite robust toward moderate changes in activity level. Use of "twin-wrist actigraphy" enables identification of artifacts that may result from breathing-related motions.},

abstract = {During the last decade actigraphy (activity-based monitoring) has become an essential tool in sleep research and sleep medicine. The validity, reliability and limitations of actigraphy for documenting sleep-wake patterns have been addressed. Normative data on sleep-wake patterns across development have been collected. Multiple studies have documented the adequacy of actigraphy to distinguish between clinical groups and to identify certain sleep-wake disorders. Actigraphy has also been shown to be effective in documenting the effects of various behavioral and medical interventions on sleep-wake patterns. Actigraphy is less useful for documenting sleep-wake in individuals who have long motionless periods of wakefulness (e.g. insomnia patients) or who have disorders that involve altered motility patterns (e.g. sleep apnea). Potential users should be aware of a number of pitfalls of actigraphy: (1) validity has not been established for all scoring algorithms or devices, or for all clinical groups; (2) actigraphy is not sufficient for diagnosis of sleep disorders in individuals with motor disorders or high motility during sleep; (3) the use of computer scoring algorithms without controlling for potential artifacts can lead to inaccurate and misleading results.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To explore the discrepancy between sleep diary and actigraphic measures of sleep in adolescents and to ascertain whether these discrepancies may vary according to characteristics of the participant. METHODS: Participants were 385 adolescents aged 13-18years (X=15.6, standard deviation [SD]=0.95; 60\% male) from eight high schools in South Australia. Adolescents completed the School Sleep Habits Survey and Pediatric Daytime Sleepiness Scale during class time, followed by an 8-day sleep diary and wrist actigraphy. The Flinders Fatigue Scale was completed on the final day of the study. Parents completed a sleep, medical, education, and family history survey. RESULTS: Actigraphic estimates of wake after sleep onset (WASO) were substantially greater than sleep diary estimates (74min actigraphy vs. 7min sleep diary) and actigraphic estimates of total sleep time were substantially less than sleep diary and parent report (6h 51min actigraphy vs. 8h 16min sleep diary vs. 8h 51 parent report). Actigraphy displayed no significant relationship with daytime functioning and weak relationships with concomitantly recorded sleep diary variables. Sex and puberty-related differences in actigraphic scoring were found, with more WASO and less sleep scored in boys compared to girls and more WASO scored amongst pubertally-mature boys than boys of less advanced pubertal development. CONCLUSIONS: There may be differences in the sleep of adolescents that result in less actigraphic total sleep scored than perceived, particularly in boys, possibly because of increased sleep motor activity in adolescents that actigraphic algorithms score as wake. This is a significant concern that requires further examination with polysomnography.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The Standards of Practice Committee of the American Sleep Disorders Association has supported the use of actigraphy in the assessment of sleep disorders. Pollak et al disagree. The objective of this paper is to identify and critically evaluate several theoretic and methodologic issues that are central to these divergent views regarding the valid use of actigraphy for sleep assessment. DESIGN: Critical review, analysis, and comment. SETTING: N/A. PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: N/A. INTERVENTIONS: N/A. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: N/A. CONCLUSIONS: (1) Coefficients of the validity of actigraphy exceed those associated with common medical tests and the best psychological tests. (2) Reasons why actigraphy should be held to a substantially higher empirical standard than common medical tests and the best psychological tests have yet to be advanced. (3) Differences between actigraphy and polysomnography are not random and can be reduced. (3a) Sleep onset is a gradual rather than a discrete process. Actigraphy keys on an earlier phase of the sleep-onset process than does polysomnography, resulting in systematic rather than random differences. (3b) A sleep switch device can be used to substantially increase the accuracy of sleep-onset times. (3c) The residual unreliability of polysomnographic data explains a portion of the differences between actigraphy and polysomnography. Actigraphy cannot be expected to agree more completely with polysomnography than polysomnography does with itself. (4) Complete agreement between actigraphy and polysomnography has been presumed, but achieving such a limit is theoretically impossible. Some lower maximum agreement limit should be identified. (5) Conclusions that actigraphy is not an accurate sleep-wake indicator and that it is inappropriate to infer sleep from actigraphy data are not supported by the findings. Conclusions reached, including caveats, by the Standards of Practice Committee remain supported.},

abstract = {Wrist activity measured with a piezoceramic transducer was digitized and analyzed together with subjects' sleep/wake status to derive an optimal method for automatic computer sleep/wake scoring. Several algorithms for quantifying periods of activity were considered, and an algorithm that summed changes in activity level over a 2-s interval was found most sensitive. A computer program for scoring sleep/wake from the resulting digital activity records was then developed, and parameters derived by comparison with subjects' sleep/wake status as determined by EEG. EEG and activity sleep/wake scores agreed 94.46\% of the time. A further prospective test of the automatic scoring system with new data yielded agreement of 96.02\%. Finally, the data collection and recording functions were implemented in a wearable microprocessor-based digital activity monitor. The automatic scoring program was adjusted to use activity data collected by this monitor, and agreed 93.88\% with EEG scoring. A prospective test with new data agreed 93.04\% with EEG. Automatic scoring of activity data for sleep/wake is not only fast and accurate, but allows sleep to be monitored in non-laboratory situations. In addition, the score is objective and reliable, and free of scorer bias and drift.},

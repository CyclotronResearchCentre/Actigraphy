Automatic actigraphic recording analysis
==========

In other words, given actigraphic recodings, detect the sleep/wake periods in an automatic way.

Limitations/warnings:
---------------------
So far 
- the development were tested on only one kind of actigraphic recordings
- it works (and assumes!) when sleep patterns are regular from a 'normal healthy' subject
- some bit of code are hard-coded for a sampling interval of 60s

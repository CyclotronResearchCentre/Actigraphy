abstract = {In summary, although actigraphy is not as accurate as PSG for determining some sleep measurements, studies are in general agreement that actigraphy, with its ability to record continuously for long time periods, is more reliable than sleep logs which rely on the patients' recall of how many times they woke up or how long they slept during the night and is more reliable than observations which only capture short time periods. Actigraphy can provide information obtainable in no other practical way. It can also have a role in the medical care of patients with sleep disorders. However, it should not be held to the same expectations as polysomnography. Actigraphy is one-dimensional, whereas polysomnography comprises at least 3 distinct types of data (EEG, EOG, EMG), which jointly determine whether a person is asleep or awake. It is therefore doubtful whether actigraphic data will ever be informationally equivalent to the PSG, although progress on hardware and data processing software is continuously being made. Although the 1995 practice parameters paper determined that actigraphy was not appropriate for the diagnosis of sleep disorders, more recent studies suggest that for some disorders, actigraphy may be more practical than PSG. While actigraphy is still not appropriate for the diagnosis of sleep disordered breathing or of periodic limb movements in sleep, it is highly appropriate for examining the sleep variability (i.e., night-to-night variability) in patients with insomnia. Actigraphy is also appropriate for the assessment of and stability of treatment effects of anything from hypnotic drugs to light treatment to CPAP, particularly if assessments are done before and after the start of treatment. A recent independent review of the actigraphy literature by Sadeh and Acebo reached many of these same conclusions. Some of the research studies failed to find relationships between sleep measures and health-related symptoms. The interpretation of these data is also not clear-cut. Is it that the actigraph is not reliable enough to the access the relationship between sleep changes and quality of life measures, or, is it that, in fact, there is no relationship between sleep in that population and quality of life measures? Other studies of sleep disordered breathing, where actigraphy was not used and was not an outcome measure also failed to find any relationship with quality of life. Is it then the actigraph that is not reliable or that the associations just do not exist? The one area where actigraphy can be used for clinical diagnosis is in the evaluation of circadian rhythm disorders. Actigraphy has been shown to be very good for identifying rhythms. Results of actigraphic recordings correlate well with measurements of melatonin and of core body temperature rhythms. Activity records also show sleep disturbance when sleep is attempted at an unfavorable phase of the circadian cycle. Actigraphy therefore would be particularly good for aiding in the diagnosis of delayed or advanced sleep phase syndrome, non-24-hour-sleep syndrome and in the evaluation of sleep disturbances in shift workers. It must be remembered, however, that overt rest-activity rhythms are susceptible to various masking effects, so they may not always show the underlying rhythm of the endogenous circadian pacemaker. In conclusion, the latest set of research articles suggest that in the clinical setting, actigraphy is reliable for evaluating sleep patterns in patients with insomnia, for studying the effect of treatments designed to improve sleep, in the diagnosis of circadian rhythm disorders (including shift work), and in evaluating sleep in individuals who are less likely to tolerate PSG, such as infants and demented elderly. While actigraphy has been used in research studies for many years, up to now, methodological issues had not been systematically addressed in clinical research and practice. Those issues have now been addressed and actigraphy may now be reaching the maturity needed for application in the clinical arena.},

abstract = {Actigraphy has become a valuable clinical and research tool to objectively evaluate sleep, daytime activity, and circadian activity rhythms in healthy individuals as well as persons with primary and comorbid insomnia. However, procedures used for sampling, data processing, and analysis are not consistently reported in the literature. The wide variability in how actigraphy is reported makes it difficult to compare findings across studies. The procedures and reporting methods from 21 studies that used actigraphs to assess sleep and wake in adult patients with cancer are reviewed to highlight the differences in reporting strategies. Patients with cancer were chosen to illustrate the methodological challenges related to procedures and reporting in one population. The aim of this article was to advance standards of information presented in publications to enable comparisons across research studies that use actigraphy. Specific methodological challenges when using actigraphy in research include instrumentation, selection of pertinent variables, sampling, and data processing and analysis. Procedural decisions are outlined and discussed, and suggestions are made for standardized actigraphy information to include in research reports. More consistent procedures and reporting will advance the science of sleep, daytime activity, and circadian activity rhythms and their association with other health-related variables.},

abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: Total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency (SE), and wake after sleep onset (WASO) as assessed by actigraphy gathered in 3 different modes were compared to polysomnography (PSG) measurements. Each mode was compared to PSG to determine which was more accurate. Associations of the difference in TST measurement with demographics and sleep characteristics were examined. DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING: Community-based. PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-eight women (mean age 81.9 years) from the latest visit of the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures who were concurrently measured with PSG and actigraphy. INTERVENTIONS: N/A. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: In-home 12-channel PSG was gathered along with actigraphy data in 3 modes: proportional integration mode (PIM), time above threshold (TAT) and zero crossings mode (ZCM). The PIM mode corresponded better to PSG, with a mean overestimation of TST of 17.9 min. For the PIM mode, the estimation of TST and SE by PSG and actigraphy significantly differed (P < 0.01), while the estimation of WASO was similar (P = 0.27). The intraclass correlation between the 2 procedures was moderate to high (PIM mode: TST 0.76; SE 0.61; WASO 0.58). On average, the PIM mode underestimated TST by 68 min for those who slept < or = 5 hr, overestimated TST by 31 min for those with SE < 70\%, and underestimated TST by 24 min for self-reported poor sleepers (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Sleep parameters from actigraphy corresponded reasonably well to PSG in this population, with the PIM mode of actigraphy correlating highest. Those with poor sleep quality had the largest measurement error between the 2 procedures.},

Forty-one subjects (18 normals and 23 with sleep or psychiatric disorders) wore a wrist actigraph during overnight polysomnography. In a randomly selected subsample of 20 subjects, candidate sleep/wake prediction algorithms were iteratively optimized against standard sleep/wake scores. The optimal algorithms obtained for various data collection epoch lengths were then prospectively tested on the remaining 21 subjects. The final algorithms correctly distinguished sleep from wakefulness approximately 88\% of the time. Actigraphic sleep percentage and sleep latency estimates correlated 0.82 and 0.90, respectively, with corresponding parameters scored from the polysomnogram (p < 0.0001). Automatic scoring of wrist activity provides valuable information about sleep and wakefulness that could be useful in both clinical and research applications.},

abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: Actigraphy is generally compared to polysomnography (PSG), which has been considered the gold standard for sleep studies. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the concordance between PSG and two previously proposed algorithms (Cole et al, 1992; Sadeh et al, 1994) to analyze actigraphic recordings. The minute-by-minute agreement rate was evaluated through calculation of sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. Regarding the sleep parameters, the concordance was performed through the Bland and Altman technique.

DESIGN: A night of adaptation to the sleep laboratory followed by simultaneous polysomnographic and actigraphic recordings throughout the night.

PARTICIPANTS: 21 healthy volunteers.

SETTING: A sleep laboratory

INTERVENTIONS: None.

RESULTS: Ninety-one percent of all PSG epochs were correctly identified by both algorithms, and this accuracy is reasonably satisfactory. The actigraphy was a sensitive method, with values of 99\% and 97\% for Cole's and Sadeh's algorithms, respectively. However, actigraphy had a low specificity: 34\% and 44\% for Cole's and Sadeh's algorithms, respectively. The Bland and Altman technique showed that actigraphy systematically overestimated Sleep Latency, Total Sleep Time and Sleep Efficiency while it underestimated Intermittent Awakenings.

CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study show the utility of actigraphy as a useful method for assessment of sleep, despite its limitations regarding identification of waking epochs during sleep. The Bland and Altman concordance technique was revealed to be a powerful tool to evaluate how well actigraphy agreed with polysomnography. This technique, combined with calculations of sensitivity and specificity, appears to be the most adequate procedure for the assessment of concordance.},

Wrist actigraphy, on the contrary, is a non-invasive and low cost solution to gather data which can provide valuable information in the diagnosis of these disorders. The acquired data may be used to infer the Sleep/Wakefulness (SW) state of the patient during the circadian cycle and detect abnormal behavioral patterns associated with these disorders. In this paper a classifier based on Autoregressive (AR) model coefficients, among other features, is proposed to estimate the SW state. The real data, acquired from 23 healthy subjects during fourteen days each, was segmented by expert medical personal with the help of complementary information such as light intensity and Sleep e-Diary information. Monte Carlo tests with a Leave-One-Out Cross Validation (LOOCV) strategy were used to assess the performance of the classifier which achieves an accuracy of 96\%.},

abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: Current actigraphic algorithms are relatively less accurate in detecting sleep and wake in sleep apnea patients than in people without sleep apnea. In the current study, we attempted to validate a novel automatic algorithm, which was developed for actigraphic studies in normal subjects and patients with obstructive sleep apnea by comparing it on an epoch-by-epoch basis to standard polysomnography. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Multicenter, university hospital, sleep laboratories. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 228 subjects from 3 different sleep centers (Skara, Boston, Haifa) participated. INTERVENTION AND MEASUREMENTS: Simultaneous recording of polysomnography and Watch\_PAT100, an ambulatory device that contains a built-in actigraph. The automatic sleep/wake algorithm is based on both the quantification of motion (magnitude and duration) and the various periodic movement patterns, such as those occurring in patients with moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea. RESULTS: The overall sensitivity and specificity to identify sleep was 89\% and 69\%, respectively. The agreement ranged from 86\% in the normal subjects to 86\%, 84\%, and 80\% in the patients with mild, moderate, and severe obstructive sleep apnea, respectively. There was a tight agreement between actigraphy and polysomnography in determining sleep efficiency (78.4 +/- 9.9 vs 78.8 +/- 13.4\%), total sleep time (690 +/- 152 vs 690 +/- 154 epochs), and sleep latency (56.8 +/- 31.4 vs 43.3 +/- 45.4 epochs). While for most individuals the difference between the polysomnography and actigraphy was relatively small, for some there was a substantial disagreement. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that this actigraphy algorithm provides a reasonably accurate estimation of sleep and wakefulness in normal subjects and patients with obstructive sleep apnea on an epoch-by-epoch basis. This simple method for assessment of total sleep time may provide a useful tool for the accurate quantification of obstructive sleep apnea in the home environment.},

abstract = {Two validation studies were conducted to optimize the sleep-detection algorithm of the Actillume. The first study used home recordings of postmenopausal women (age range: 51 to 77 years), which were analyzed to derive the optimal algorithm for detecting sleep and wakefulness from wrist activity data, both for nocturnal in-bed recordings and considering the entire 24 h. The second study explored the optimal algorithm to score in-bed recordings of healthy young adults (age range: 19 to 34 years) monitored in the laboratory. In Study I, the algorithm for in-bed recordings (n=39) showed a minute-by-minute agreement of 85\% between Actillume and polysomnography (PSG), a correlation of.98, and a mean measurement error (ME) of 21 min for estimates of sleep duration. Using the same algorithm to score 24-h recordings with Webster's rules, an agreement of 89\%, a correlation of.90, and 1 min ME were observed. A different algorithm proved optimal to score in-bed recordings (n=31) of young adults, yielding an agreement of 91\%, a correlation of.92, and an ME of 5 min. The strong correlations and agreements between sleep estimates from Actillume and PSG in both studies suggest that the Actillume can reliably monitor sleep and wakefulness both in community-residing elderly and healthy young adults in the laboratory. However, different algorithms are optimal for individuals with different characteristics.},

METHODS: We compared three currently used algorithms (the Cole-Kripke, Sadeh, and University of California San Diego [UCSD]) and determined which is the most reliable in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) assessing total sleep time. After identification of the most reliable algorithm, we compared total sleep time with the severity of obstructive sleep apnea. RESULTS: The mean total sleep time was not significantly different from that yielded by polysomnography when the UCSD algorithm was employed (p = 0.798) and UCSD algorithm was associated with the smallest bias. The correlation levels (with polysomnographic data) were mild-to-modest when the results yielded by all algorithms were evaluated, but were highest when the UCSD algorithm was employed (UCSD, r = 0.498, p < 0.001; Cole-Kripke, r = 0.389, p < 0.01; Sadeh, r = 0.272, p = 0.057). Actigraphic measures of mean total sleep time underestimated sleep in patients with severe obstructive sleep apnea (apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] ≥30), and the correlation was low (r = 0.317, p = 0.116), but overestimated sleep, with high correlations, in patients with mild (5 ≤ AHI < 15) and moderate OSA (15 ≤ AHI < 30; r = 0.859, p < 0.001; r = 0.842, p < 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Among the three actigraphic algorithms tested in this study, sleep duration estimated by the UCSD algorithm was the most correlated with polysomnography data in an OSA population. However, none of them was reliable enough for estimating sleep time in patients with sleep-disordered breathing, especially in patients with severe OSA.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To determine the accuracy of a new actigraphy system for the measurement of periodic leg movements (PLMs). Continuous measurements of leg movements, made overnight, are essential to diagnose and monitor treatment for PLMs. We have developed the Actiwatch with Cambridge Neuro-Technology Ltd (Cambridge, UK) to detect leg movements consistent with PLMs, to record these movements from both feet over three consecutive nights and to report standard indices of PLMs. We describe three studies designed to validate this device. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The Actiwatch was assessed on a bench model across a range of movement amplitudes. The level of agreement on individual movements between the Actiwatch and bilateral anterior tibialis electromyography (BATEMG) measures was assessed in 199 epochs from five patients with known PLMs. The ability of the Actiwatch to correctly identify patients with PLMs was assessed in a comparison with polysomnography (PSG) in 50 consecutive patients investigated in the sleep laboratory. RESULTS: The Actiwatch detected all mechanically generated movements (100\% sensitivity and 100\% specificity) on the bench test. On individual movements BATEMG measurement and the Actiwatch agreed on 94\% of epochs. The sensitivity and specificity of the Actiwatch to detect leg movements in severe PLMs as defined by BATEMG (PLMI>or=25) are high (100\% sensitive and 97\% specific). Our bilateral system gave better agreement with BATEMG than previous systems but the two measures are still not interchangeable. CONCLUSIONS: EMG is only a surrogate measure of limb movement and indices measured in this way correlate poorly with symptoms. We have demonstrated that the Actiwatch faithfully records movement, which offers the potential to reassess the relationships between limb movement indices and symptoms. This which offers a convenient and economical alternative to PSG in the study of large populations to increase our understanding of the epidemiology and clinical significance of PLMs.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Comparison of polysomnography (PSG)-derived sleep parameters (total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and number of awakenings) to those derived from actigraphy and subjective questionnaires. BACKGROUND: Actigraphy is commonly used to assist sleep specialists in the diagnosis of various sleep and circadian-rhythm disorders. However, few validation studies incorporate large sample sizes, typical sleep clinic patients, or comparisons with subjective reports of sleep parameters. METHODS: Clinical series with 100 consecutive sleep-disordered patients (69 men, 31 women, mean age of 49+/-14.7 years) at a tertiary sleep disorders center. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy measures were obtained from epoch-by-epoch comparison of PSG and actigraphic data. Subjective sleep parameter data were derived from questionnaires given to subjects in the morning following their recording night. RESULTS: We found that total sleep time and sleep efficiency did not significantly differ between PSG data and the combined data obtained from actigraphy and subjective reports. Using a high-threshold (low-wake-sensitivity) actigraphic algorithm, the number of awakenings was not significantly different from those detected by PSG. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend the use of subjective data as an adjunct to actigraphic data in estimating total sleep time and sleep efficiency in sleep-disordered patients, especially those with disorders of excessive somnolence.},

abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: Vivago WristCare is a new activity monitoring device, which allows long-term online monitoring of the activity of the user. This study evaluates the ability of the device to discriminate sleep/wake patterns during nighttime and during napping. DESIGN: Participants spent one night in the sleep laboratory where signals from polysomnography, actigraphy and WristCare were acquired. In addition, actigraphy and WristCare were used for 3-6 days for nap-analysis. SETTING: NA. PATIENTS OR PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 32 adults aged 26-89 years. The participants were studied in three study groups: all subjects, senior subjects (age > 65 years) and middle-aged subjects (age < 65 years). INTERVENTIONS: NA. RESULTS: Sleep/wake patterns were extracted from polysomnography, actigraphy and WristCare for the night slept in sleep laboratory. The agreement percents between the scorings of polysomnography and actigraphy, and between polysomnography and WristCare were about 80 \% for all study groups. As total sleep time was estimated and the algorithm was optimized for this measure, the performance of the WristCare and actigraphy were similar. Both actigraphy and WristCare overestimated appreciably total sleep time (TST). Also in nap-analysis, actigraphy and WristCare performed similarly as the number of naps and the length of the naps were compared. CONCLUSIONS: The performance of the WristCare can be assumed to be well comparable to actigraphy in sleep/wake studies. The study suggests that the device may be used in long-term monitoring of sleep/wake patterns with similar performance to actigraphy.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to compare the extent to which activity and immobility measures are related to sleep stages and sleep cycles in order to improve the informative value of actigraphic assessment of sleep. We therefore performed simultaneous ambulatory polysomnography and wrist-activity monitoring (AM) in 14 healthy male subjects without sleep complaints. In this context, a simple method for transforming raw motor activity data into a time-series reflecting onset and duration of activity and immobility clusters is introduced. Our results demonstrate that nocturnal AM measures were significantly affected by sleep stage. Low activity levels and particularly prolonged episodes of uninterrupted immobility were associated with increasing sleep depth. On the other hand, high activity levels and prolonged episodes of activity were related to intermittent wakefulness during sleep. Our results suggest that measures reflecting the occurrence and duration of activity and immobility clusters provide a better approach in studying the relationship between activity/immobility and sleep stages. Except for the duration of uninterrupted immobility episodes, which showed a significant decrease in the fourth cycle, none of the AM measures showed a significant cycle-to-cycle variation. Consequently, mean nocturnal motor activity measures provide an accurate reflection of the total sleep period. However, none of the AM-derived measures seems useful in evaluating the cycle structure during sleep.},

Results from the two Sleep/Wake estimations agreed for 94.5\% of the minutes ((96.3\% among nonpatients). Correlations between the two methods were determined for Total Sleep Period (r = 0.90). Total Sleep Time (r = 0.89), Wake After Sleep Onset (r = 0.70), and the number of Midsleep Awakenings (r = 0.25). Correlation coefficients were higher when the 39 patients were excluded from the computations. On the average, the actigraphic method overestimated Sleep Time by 15 min. Continuous wrist activity recordings provide simple and inexpensive, but rather accurate, estimates of sleep duration.},

abstract = {Study Objectives: To evaluate the ability of actigraphy compared to polysomnography (PSG) to detect wakefulness in subjects submitted to 3 sleep conditions with different amounts of wakefulness: a nocturnal sleep episode and 2 daytime recovery sleep episodes, one with placebo and one with caffeine. A second objective was to compare the ability of 4 differ- ent scoring algorithms (2 threshold algorithms and 2 regression analysis algorithms) to detect wake in the 3 sleep conditions. Design: Three nights of simultaneous actigraphy (Actiwatch-L, Mini-Mit- ter/Respironics) and PSG recordings in a within-subject design. Setting: Chronobiology laboratory. Participants: Fifteen healthy subjects aged between 20 and 60 years (7M, 8F). Interventions: 200 mg of caffeine and daytime recovery sleep. Results: An epoch-by-epoch comparison between actigraphy and PSG showed a significant decrease in actigraphy accuracy with increased wakefulness in sleep conditions due to the low sleep specificity of actigraphy (generally <50\%). Actigraphy overestimated total sleep time and sleep efficiency more strongly in conditions involving more wakefulness. Compared to the 2 regression algorithms, the 2 threshold algorithms were less able to detect wake when the sleep episode involved more wakeful- ness, and they tended to alternate more between wake and sleep in the scoring of long periods of wakefulness resulting in an overestimation of the number of awakenings. Conclusion: The very low ability of actigraphy to detect wakefulness casts doubt on its validity to measure sleep quality in clinical populations with fragmented sleep or in situations where the sleep-wake cycle is chal- lenged, such as jet lag and shift work.},

Although activity levels differed between dominant and nondominant wrists during periods of sleep (F = 4.57; p < 0.05) and wake (F = 15.5; p < 0.0005), resulting sleep-wake scoring algorithms were essentially the same and were equally explanatory (R2 = 0.64; p < 0.0001). When the sleep-wake scoring algorithm derived from the nondominant hand was used to score the nondominant data for sleep-wake, overall agreement rates with polysomnography scoring ranged between 91 and 93\% for the calibration and validation samples. Results obtained with the same algorithm for the dominant-wrist data were within the same range. Agreement for sleep scoring was consistently higher than for wake scoring. Statistical manipulation of activity levels before applying the scoring algorithm indicated that this algorithm is quite robust toward moderate changes in activity level. Use of "twin-wrist actigraphy" enables identification of artifacts that may result from breathing-related motions.},

The validity, reliability and limitations of actigraphy for documenting sleep-wake patterns have been addressed. Normative data on sleep-wake patterns across development have been collected. Multiple studies have documented the adequacy of actigraphy to distinguish between clinical groups and to identify certain sleep-wake disorders. Actigraphy has also been shown to be effective in documenting the effects of various behavioral and medical interventions on sleep-wake patterns. Actigraphy is less useful for documenting sleep-wake in individuals who have long motionless periods of wakefulness (e.g. insomnia patients) or who have disorders that involve altered motility patterns (e.g. sleep apnea). Potential users should be aware of a number of pitfalls of actigraphy: (1) validity has not been established for all scoring algorithms or devices, or for all clinical groups; (2) actigraphy is not sufficient for diagnosis of sleep disorders in individuals with motor disorders or high motility during sleep; (3) the use of computer scoring algorithms without controlling for potential artifacts can lead to inaccurate and misleading results.},

@article{Webster1982,
abstract = {Wrist activity measured with a piezoceramic transducer was digitized and analyzed together with subjects' sleep/wake status to derive an optimal method for automatic computer sleep/wake scoring. Several algorithms for quantifying periods of activity were considered, and an algorithm that summed changes in activity level over a 2-s interval was found most sensitive. A computer program for scoring sleep/wake from the resulting digital activity records was then developed, and parameters derived by comparison with subjects' sleep/wake status as determined by EEG. EEG and activity sleep/wake scores agreed 94.46\% of the time. A further prospective test of the automatic scoring system with new data yielded agreement of 96.02\%. Finally, the data collection and recording functions were implemented in a wearable microprocessor-based digital activity monitor. The automatic scoring program was adjusted to use activity data collected by this monitor, and agreed 93.88\% with EEG scoring. A prospective test with new data agreed 93.04\% with EEG. Automatic scoring of activity data for sleep/wake is not only fast and accurate, but allows sleep to be monitored in non-laboratory situations. In addition, the score is objective and reliable, and free of scorer bias and drift.},
